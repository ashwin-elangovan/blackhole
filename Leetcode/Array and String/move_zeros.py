# Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

# Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
# Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

# Fast pointer will handle non-zero elements
# Slow pointer will handle zero elements

class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: list) -> None:
        slow = 0
        for fast in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[fast] != 0 and nums[slow] == 0:
                nums[slow], nums[fast] = nums[fast], nums[slow]

            # wait while we find a non-zero element to swap with you
            if nums[slow] != 0:
                slow += 1
