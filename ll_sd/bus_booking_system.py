Bus booking system.

List of buses with source to destination information ( no need think about timings, overlapping etc)

One should be able to book the bus from one location to the other.
The routes can be directly or indirectly.

For example.
if one wants to book a bus from A to C :
it should show list like this :
bus a : A-C (direct)
bus b :A-B , bus c :A-C ( indirect path)
and so on ..

I was asked to come up with an optimal db shcema design.
