# Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

# The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

# Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

# You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
# Example 2:


# Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
# Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
